Introduction
huhloWave ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, huhloWave ("the App"). The App enables users to exchange wave sounds between vehicles via Bluetooth, manage profiles, and view leaderboards. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand our practices regarding your information. By accessing or using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the App.

The App is rated 4+ on the App Store, and its content is safe for users of all ages. The App is primarily intended for legal vehicle users, such as drivers, to facilitate vehicle-to-vehicle wave exchanges. However, passengers of any age, including minors, may also use the App as long as their device is connected to a vehicle’s Bluetooth system. For example, a minor (e.g., a 12-year-old) riding as a passenger may use the App when their device is paired with the vehicle’s Bluetooth, whether the vehicle belongs to a parent, guardian, or another driver. The App does not distinguish between drivers and passengers and does not require age validation for account creation or usage.

Information We Collect
We collect the following categories of information when you use the App:

1. Personal Information:
   - Email Address: Collected for user authentication and account management.
   - Display Name: A 3-character identifier you provide during profile creation to identify your profile on the leaderboard.
   - Vehicle VIN: Used to identify your vehicle’s make and model via the NHTSA VIN lookup API.
   - Selected Bluetooth Device: The Bluetooth identifier of your vehicle to enable vehicle-to-vehicle wave exchanges.

2. Device Information:
   - Device Type, Operating System Version, and Unique Device Identifiers: Collected via Firebase for authentication, crash reporting, and analytics (if enabled).

4. Third-Party Data:
   - Vehicle Make and Model: Retrieved via the NHTSA VIN lookup API based on the VIN you provide. This API does not collect or store personal information beyond the VIN you provide.

5. Location Data:
   - Background Location: We request "always" location access to detect driving activity and enable wave exchanges while the App is in the background. We do not store or share your location data; it is used solely to facilitate wave exchanges.

We do not collect sensitive personal information such as financial data, health information, or precise location data beyond what is necessary for the App’s functionality.

We may also disclose your information in the following circumstances:

- Legal Requirements: If required by law, regulation, or legal process (e.g., court order, subpoena), or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public.
- Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

Your Rights and Choices
You have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- Access and Update: You can view and update your profile information (e.g., display name, VIN, Bluetooth device, selected sound) directly within the App.
- Delete Your Account: You can delete your account at any time using the "Delete Account" feature in the App’s settings. This will remove all your personal information from our servers, including your email address, profiles, and associated data.
- Data Portability: You may request a copy of your personal information by contacting us at the email address provided below. We will provide the data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.

Security of Your Information
We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption for data transmission, secure storage with Firebase, and access controls. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

Children’s Privacy
The App’s content is safe for users of all ages and is rated 4+ on the App Store. While the App is intended for legal vehicle users (e.g., drivers), passengers of any age, including minors, may use the App when their device is connected to a vehicle’s Bluetooth system. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age in violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will promptly delete it from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately at the email address below, and we will take steps to remove that information.

We do not require age validation for account creation or usage, as the App’s functionality does not depend on the user’s age but rather on their device being connected to a vehicle’s Bluetooth system. Parents or guardians are responsible for supervising minors’ use of the App, particularly in a vehicle context.

Third-Party Links and Services
The App may contain links to third-party websites or services (e.g., the NHTSA VIN lookup API). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you interact with through the App.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or the App’s functionality. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
